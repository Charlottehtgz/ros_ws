### HCR 2023 at Imperial: Speech of RobotFetch 

This is a ROS workspace. 

There are 2 ROS packages which realize speech recognition and keyword detection for audio received and direction of arrival received from ReSpeaker through Socket.

This is based on https://github.com/alphacep/ros-vosk.

Alternatively, if use Docker, simply: 

```python
docker pull sarahzhang991105/speechfinal

docker run --network host --name containername -it sarahzhang991105/speechfinal

```




This workspace is in the /root repository.

Thanks and best wishes to all my teammates who contributed to HCR RobotFetch.
